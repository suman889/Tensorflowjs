# TensorFlow.js
TensorFlow.js, an open-source library you can use to define, train, and run machine learning models entirely in the browser, using JavaScript and a high-level layers API. If you’re a JavaScript developer who’s new to ML, TensorFlow.js is a great way to begin learning.

# MobileNet
MobileNets are small, low-latency, low-power models parameterized to meet the resource constraints of a variety of use cases. They can be built upon for classification, detection, embedding and segmentation.
